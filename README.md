## Project Description

We have two types of classes **Model** and **View** they both have diffrent functionlity in our project.

Typescript has a distinct OOP style

Many popular JS libs were written before JS ahad any solid idea of 'classes'

Integrating TS with popular JS libs can be tough

TS with JS libs
use the lib normally, adding in basic type annotations where possible
Use a TS adapter library that has helpers for using your lib with TS
Twist your lib to work with TS classes
